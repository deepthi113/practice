The energy source of high-power photovoltaic systems consists
of strings of series-connected solar panels. Apart from energy conversion,
the power processing unit (PPU) in those systems also performs
an important function of tracking and matching the
maximum power point (MPP) of the string to deliver maximum
power to the load. Many MPP tracking techniques, such as
power-matching.
