algorithm for PV systems operating under rapidly fluctuating
irradiance is proposed. The first step determines the string voltage
at which the GMPP appears. It is based on extracting the powervoltage
characteristics of the string through varying the input
impedance of the PPU to determine the approximate location of
the GMPP.
